# Network resources

every subnet loses 5 IP

peering: span different regions to connect Vnets together

on-premise to vnet (need vpn gateway)

site to site VPN, over internet

vpn gateways: two

1. policy gateway: only one connection, static, limited, dont want to use
2. route-based: supports different routes, multiple connections

point to site, developer from home device to Vnet

express route: private connection, not over internet

two modes of communication

1. private peering: expressroute gateway to exchange information
2. MSFT peering

service endpoints: better routes, can hop over firewall

private endpoint: particular endpoint
