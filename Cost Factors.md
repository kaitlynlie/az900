shifts development costs from capital expense (CapEx) of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an operational expense (OpEx)

OpEx cost:

- resource type
- consumption
- maintenance
- geography
- subscription type
- azure marketplace

## Resource type

cost of resources = type of resources, settings for resources, Azure region

storage = blob, performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings, region

VM = licensing for OS, processor, cores, attached storage, network interface

## Consumption

can commit to using set amount of cloud resources in advance and receiving discounts on those “reserved” resources (up to 72%)

## Network traffic

zone: geographical grouping of Azure regions for billing purposes
