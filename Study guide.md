horizontal scaling: increase compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to configuration

vertical scaling: add RAM and CPUs to VMs

availability zones: physically separate datacenters within Azure region, primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, SQL databases

region pair: region paired with another region in the same geography, replication of Azure resources across geographies to ensure business continuity during natural disaster

peering: link virtual networks, enables resources in virtual network to communicate

ExpressRoute: connect on-premises network to Azure

NSGs: configure inbound/outbound rules for virtual networks and VMs

service endpoints: expose Azure services to virtual network, providing communication between the two

blob storage: good location to store backups and archives, low storage costs and unlimited file formats

Azure Disk Storage: provides disks for VMs

Azure files: mounting file storage shares

Azure reservations: discounted prices

Azure policy: create policy for allowed regions, restrict deployment to a specific location

health advisories: issues that require you to take proactive action to avoid service interruptions, such as service retirements and breaking changes

service issues: outages that require immediate action
