Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, providing communication between the two. ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure. NSGs allow you to configure inbound and outbound rules for virtual networks and virtual machines. Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together.

Agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements change. Scalability means that you can add RAM, CPU, or entire virtual machines to a configuration. Elasticity means that you can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so apps always have the resources they need. High availability means that cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

Elasticity refers to the ability to scale resources as needed, such as during business hours, to ensure that an application can keep up with demand, and then reducing the available resources during off-peak hours. Agility refers to the ability to deploy new applications and services quickly. High availability refers to the ability to ensure that a service or application remains available in the event of a failure. Geo-distribution makes a service or application available in multiple geographic locations that are typically close to your users.
