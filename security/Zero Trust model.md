# Zero Trust model

security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation, requires everyone to authenticate

assumes breach at outset, then verifies each request as though it originated from uncontrolled network

guiding principles:

- verify explicitly: always authenticate/authorize based on all available data points
- use least privilege access: limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access, risk-based adaptive policies, data protection
- assume breach

identity: RBAC, MFA, authentication

endpoint: device certification, managed, registered

network: where is internet coming from, encrypting

= context to control what we let you do

conditional access
